=====================================================

## Objectives
* Install node from source
* Sumbit this an assignment the 401 way

### Install node from Source
#### Out with the old
First type `which node && which npm` if you get anything other than a blank line you already have node installed and need to remove it. If you used the node installer from their website use these commands:
```
sudo rm -rf $(which node)
sudo rm -rf $(which npm)
sudo rm -rf ~/.node
sudo rm -rf ~/.npm
```
Now if you type `which node && which npm` you should have a blank line.

#### In with the new
These instructions will help you install the latest version of node in a way the prevents you from needing root to install
global packages. You will need curl, python v2.x a C compiler(gcc or clang) and make installed. These can be obtained through whatever package manager your operating system uses (homebrew on Mac, apt-get on Ubuntu, etc).
```
curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.4.3/node-v4.4.3.tar.gz
tar -vxzf node-v4.4.3.tar.gz
cd node-v4.4.3
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.node
make && make install
```
These commands will download the latest stable version of node (currently 4.4.3) configure it to install into a .node folder in your 
home directory and will then compile it from source. Next you need to tell your shell to look for the node command in $HOME/.node/bin   

On Linux:
```
echo "export PATH=$HOME/.node/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export NODE_PATH=$HOME/.node/lib/node_modules" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
On Mac:
```
echo "export PATH=$HOME/.node/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "export NODE_PATH=$HOME/.node/lib/node_modules" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```
If you now enter the command `node --version` you should see `v4.4.3`

## How code assignments will be sumbitted
All coding assignments in the 401n1 night class will be sumbitted through a pull request to the appropriate _assignment repository_.  

Each Code Assignment (Lab/Homework/ect) will have a unique repository with a README.md with the instructions for the assignment. Any special materiales needed for the assignment will be included in the _assignment repository_.  

For each assignment you will fork the _assignment repository_ clone your fork onto your computer. Make a directory named with your name, do all of the work for the assignment in that directory. As you work in your fork you will work in a branch that follows the nameing convention `yourname-feature` and you will use *good git pratices*. When you are ready to sumbit your assigmnet you will make a pull request from the master-branch of your GitHub fork to the master-branch of the original Assignment. Then  you will copy the url of your pull request and paste it into the assignmnet on canvas.  

### Sumbit a pull request with a hello world program
The final instruction for this assignment is to write a hello world program, and sumbit it by following the previous instructions.
* Fork this repository
* Clone your fork
* Make a directory named `yourname`
* Crate a branch named `yourname-helloworld`
* In the directory with your name make a javascript file called helloworld.js
* In helloworld.js write  
```
console.log('hello, <your name>');
```
* run the program by typing `node helloworld.js` in your shell
 * if the program runs with out errors, push it up to github, then create a pull requset to this assignment from your fork.
 * if you get an error, fix you code before you sumbit
